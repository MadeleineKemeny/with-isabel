            <h3>Blogs We Love</h3>
            <br>
            <h4><a href="http://www.vinography.com/">Vinography</a></h4>
            <p>Alder Yarrow is a San Francisco high-tech consultant and wine geek who runs Vinography, perhaps the Web's
                most popular and comprehensive wine blog. Like many bloggers, he's obsessed with what he calls his
                second career. "Instead of watching TV, I blog," he says. "I believe telling stories about a wine helps
                remove it from the realm of high status where all we know about it is the price." In addition to
                Yarrow's wine writing, Vinography includes his restaurant reviews. For instance, he raves about the duck
                and quince salad, the ravioli—and, yes, the wine list—at Quince in San Francisco. It also features links
                to articles in magazines, newspapers and other blogs.</p>
            <br>
            <h4><a href="http://www.wineanorak.com/wineblog/">Jamie Goode's Wine Blog</a></h4>
            <p>Jamie Goode, a Brit, writes for several well-known English wine magazines and runs the Wine Anorak
                website, which offers excellent articles about wine travel, winemakers and wine tasting. He saves his
                more casual writing for his blog, in which he's refreshingly candid about the daily life of a wine
                professional. "We've had a huge rise in the number of samples landing on the doorstop chez Goode…It's
                not that there's anything wrong with samples; rather, the problem is that you end up focusing on a
                skewed population of wines—those that people are most anxious to flog."</p>
            <br>
            <h4><a href="https://winefolly.com/blog/">Wine Folly</a></h4>
            <p>Madeline Pucketette, Cofounder and Wine Expert on Wine Folly, started writing for people who want to know
                more about wine but they don’t know where to start. The goal of Wine Folly is to share wine knowledge in
                a way to encourage and inspire new drinkers. Besides being a Certified Sommelier with Court of Masters
                and an active member of Guild of Sommeliers, her personal education includes advanced seminars,
                tastings, and traveling to wine regions of the world. She is also a frequent contributor to national
                newspapers, a top writer on Quora, and was the IWSC Wine Blogger of the Year, 2013-2014.</p>
            <br>
            <h4><a href="https://www.drvino.com/">Dr. Vino's Wine Blog</a></h4>
            <p>Dr. Vino, a.k.a. Tyler Colman, really is a doctor—he wrote his doctoral dissertation at Northwestern
                University about the political economy of the wine industries in France and the United States. After
                teaching political science for two years, he settled into full-time wine writing and education. On
                his blog (a part of the Dr. Vino Web site), Colman intelligently explores the intersection of wine,
                politics and business. For example, he recently explained—in clear, compelling terms—how the Costco
                case before the Seattle federal district court could lead to an even bigger dismantling of the
                three-tier wine distribution system than the Supreme Court's recent decision on interstate shipment
                of wine.</p>
            <br>
            <h4><a href="http://thefeiringline.com/blog/">The Feiring Line</a></h4>
            <p>The wine and travel columnist for Time magazine, Alice Feiring uses her blog to share her thoughts
                on everything from biodynamic winemaking to pairing wild ramps and red Burgundy. In her mission
                statement, she writes, "I'm looking for the Leon Trotskys, the Philip Roths, the Chaucers and the
                Edith Whartons of the wine world. I want my wines to tell a good story. I want them natural and most
                of all, like my dear friends, I want them to speak the truth even if we argue."</p>

            <h4><a href="https://www.wineterroirs.com/">Wine Tasting, Vineyards, in France</a></h4>
            <p>French photographer Bertrand Celce travels the wine routes of his country and records his encounters
                in both vivid pictures and somewhat fractured English with the vignerons he meets along the way. For
                example, Celce profiles Junko Arai, a Japanese wine importer who recently began making wine in the
                Loire, describing her efforts to gain appellation status for her bottlings. Celce also offers
                insights on everything from corks to the best Paris wine bars­, both legendary (the venerable Caves
                Legrand) and neighborhoody (Le Verre à Pied).
